Random Walk on a Lattice Graph
==============================
Probability distributions on a fractal graph...
-----------------------------------------------


Written for S.M. Ali Tabei for a random-walk simulation. A quick program to:


 - Generate a triangular lattice graph
 - Layout the graph in Cartesian space
 - Execute a random walk on the graph


With facilities to output both the graph and the probability distribution over the graph.


What you do with this is up to you!
